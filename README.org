* My Nix Configuration

This is a work-in-progress configuration for my NixOS setup.

** Setup

This configuration is managed with Nix flakes. To use this configuration:

1. Enable flakes on your system if you haven't already done so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   nixos-rebuild switch --flake path/to/your/flake#yourSystemName
   #+END_SRC

   Replace /path/to/your/flake/ with the path to this directory and /yourSystemName/ with the name of your system configuration.

2. Run the rebuild command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   nixos-rebuild switch --flake path/to/your/flake#yourSystemName
   #+END_SRC

** Status

This is a work in progress. The configuration is not yet complete and may change significantly.

** Feedback

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
