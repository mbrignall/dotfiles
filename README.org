* My Nix Configuration

[[https://nixos.org][https://img.shields.io/badge/NixOS-grey.svg?style=flat-square&logo=NixOS&logoColor=white]]

This is a work-in-progress configuration for my NixOS and home-manager setup.

** Setup

This configuration is managed with Nix flakes. To use this configuration:

   Replace /path/to/your/flake/ with the path to this directory and /yourSystemName/ with the name of your system configuration.

- Run the rebuild command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake path/to/your/flake#yourSystemName
   #+END_SRC

** Status

This is a work in progress. The configuration is not yet complete and may change significantly.

** Feedback

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
